    "The world of sports betting is a multi-billion-dollar industry, a chaotic marketplace where passion for sport collides with the calculus of probability. For many, betting is driven by gut instinct and the thrill of the game. For bookmakers it is a precisely engineered business, where odds are set not just to predict outcomes, but to balance books and ensure a profit regardless of the result. This profit, the \"vig\", is the market's built-in testament to their model and immanent inefficiency of the crowd. The prevailing wisdom suggest that for the average bettor, beating the bookmaker long-term is fool's errand- a game where the odds are permanently stacked against them.\n",

I questioned this accepted idea by implementing a system that would approach the betting market not as a fan, but as an analyst. The project uses machine learning to independently forecast sports mach outcomes and indentify situation where its assessment of probability disagrees with the market's.\n",
